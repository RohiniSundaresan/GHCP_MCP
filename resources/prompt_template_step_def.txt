Act as a BDD automation expert. Given a Gherkin feature file, generate a new step definition TypeScript file in step-definitions/ for the provided feature. Follow these instructions:

Analyze the feature file and understand the scenario steps.
Search for existing step definitions in step-definitions/. If a step is already implemented, do not duplicate it.
Reuse and import page objects from pages/ (e.g., KemperPage) and invoke their methods for browser actions and assertions.
Use locators by XPath only, as per the framework’s standards.
If a required page action or selector does not exist, generate a new page file or method in pages/.
Use test data from test-data/ if needed.
Follow the code style and structure of existing step definitions and hooks.
Output only the new or updated TypeScript code for the step definition file, aligning with the framework’s conventions.
Input: {bdd}

Expected output:
A new TypeScript file in step-definitions/ implementing only the missing steps, reusing existing code and page objects.
